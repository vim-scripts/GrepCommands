DESCRIPTION
This plugin defines variants of the built-in :vimgrep command which target
all arguments, listed buffers, windows in the current tab page or all tab
pages for its search. Additionally, the search defaults to the current search
string, so using these commands is often much faster than building the
equivalent search with :vimgrep.

SEE ALSO
- The GrepHere plugin (vimscript #4191) provides a :GrepHere command that
  covers only the current buffer.

RELATED WORKS
- This is a modern re-implementation of the similar commands defined by
  greputils.vim (vimscript #1062), which hasn't been updated since 2005.
